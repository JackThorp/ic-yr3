gl_Vertex in shader specifies the objects coordinates (coordinates of vertex in local model which
is specific to each object). 

All objects are trandformed into common coordinate system - the  view space. Conceptually first to
world coordinate system and then to view space. In practise these are combined into one transformation,
the model-view transformation)

Hence, gl_ModelViewMatrix which performs the model-view transformation.
